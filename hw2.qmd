# Contributing to Class Notes
## a.
First I went to the class GitHub and created a new fork in my own 
GitHub account.
## b.
Then, I copied the SSH link and cloned the fork into the "2-contributing-
to-class-notes-hlevine105" folder on my computer. I now have a new folder 
inside that one, titled "ids-f25". I went into this folder on Git Bash.
## c.
Next, I tried to render the folder, but ran into ModuleNotFoundError:
no module named scipy. To fix this, I created a virtual environment, and
downloaded and installed requirements.txt. I then tried to render the folder again,
and was successful this time. It created an output, _book/index.html.
## d.
I created a new branch titled "wishlist-update" and switched into it.
## e.
I tried to commit this file with my documented steps up until now.
I have been making sure to make many small commits after each step. However,
when I tried to add the file to stage, it gave me" fatal: pathspec 'hw2.qmd' 
did not match any files". The file I had been working on was inside the 
"2-contributing-to-class-notes-hlevine105" folder, and in Git Bash I was in
"2-contributing-to-class-notes-hlevine105/ids-f25 (wishlist-update)". I fixed
this by doing the command mv ../hw2.qmd ." to move the file to the repo folder
I was working in. When I did "git status" to check if the file was now in the
correct location, it verified that I had successful moved the file. I was then able
to add the file and commit my changes. I had to close the file I had open in VS Code 
and reopen it in VS Code in the repo folder. I am now adding my wishes to the index.qmd file.
