# Contributing to Class Notes
## a.
First I went to the class GitHub and created a new fork in my own 
GitHub account.
## b.
Then, I copied the SSH link and cloned the fork into the "2-contributing-
to-class-notes-hlevine105" folder on my computer. I now have a new folder 
inside that one, titled "ids-f25". I went into this folder on Git Bash.
## c.
Next, I tried to render the folder, but ran into ModuleNotFoundError:
no module named scipy. To fix this, I created a virtual environment, and
downloaded and installed requirements.txt. I then tried to render the folder again,
and was successful this time. It created an output, _book/index.html.
## d.
I created a new branch titled "wishlist-update" and switched into it.
